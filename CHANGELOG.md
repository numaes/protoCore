# Changelog

All notable changes to protoCore are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- **`ProtoObject::partialCompare`** — an IEEE partial-order comparison that
  returns `std::partial_ordering`. Numbers compare by exact value across
  SmallInteger, LargeInteger and double (-0.0 is equivalent to 0.0 and to 0);
  any NaN is unordered with everything, itself included, so `<`, `<=`, `==`,
  `>=` and `>` against 0 are false and `!=` is true; strings compare by
  content; other pairs are equivalent when identical and unordered otherwise.
  `compare` now delegates to it and keeps its behaviour: an unordered numeric
  pair (a NaN) still compares as 0, and non-numeric pairs still order by
  address. Embedders that implement comparison operators with `compare`
  (where `NaN = 1` and `NaN <= 1` are true) can switch to `partialCompare`.
  The public header now includes `<compare>`; adding a non-virtual member
  does not change any layout.
- **Unmanaged-region API for blocking OS calls** — new pair of methods on
  `ProtoThread` and `ProtoContext`: `goUnmanaged()` /
  `returnFromUnmanaged()`. Bracket a blocking OS call (`read`, `write`,
  `poll`, `sleep`, network I/O, third-party C library calls) with this
  pair and the GC's stop-the-world quorum will NOT wait for that thread
  to reach a real safepoint — the thread is pre-counted as parked in
  `ProtoSpace::parkedThreads` for the duration of the region. Without
  this, a single thread blocked in a slow syscall could pause every
  other thread in the process behind the GC quorum until the syscall
  returned. Calls nest (depth counter per thread; outermost pair manages
  the quorum slot). `returnFromUnmanaged()` blocks if a STW phase is in
  progress at the moment of return, matching the behaviour of a normal
  safepoint park. A `ProtoContext::UnmanagedScope` RAII helper
  guarantees the matching return runs on every exit path including
  exceptions. The per-thread counter lives on `ProtoThreadExtension`
  (not on the 64-byte `ProtoThreadImplementation` Cell). See DESIGN.md
  §"Unmanaged regions: blocking OS calls without blocking the GC" for
  the full contract — particularly the rule that NO `ProtoObject*`
  access is permitted while unmanaged.
- **Caller-supplied element hash for `ProtoSet`** — `ProtoSet::addWithHash`,
  `hasHash` and `removeHash` take the hash explicitly, and
  `ProtoSetIterator::nextHash` returns the hash an element is stored under,
  so set operations (union, intersection, subset tests) can combine sets
  without hashing elements again. This lets a runtime whose equality differs
  from protoCore's use `ProtoSet`: in Python, `1`, `1.0` and `True` are one
  set element and a class's `__hash__` decides membership. A set must be
  accessed through one hash function only.
- **`PROTOCORE_TRUST_SYMBOLS` environment variable (experimental)** — when the
  variable is set (to any value), `getAttribute`, `hasAttribute` and
  `hasOwnAttribute` no longer resolve a non-interned string name through
  `SymbolTable::lookupByContent`; they report the attribute as absent. It is a
  measurement aid for embedders that always pass interned symbols: on the
  protoJS standard benchmark suite it reduced times by 4–22%, while call sites
  that pass non-interned names read back `PROTO_NONE` and take slower fallback
  paths. Write paths (`setAttribute`, `setAttributeIfEqual`,
  `deleteAttribute`) still intern string names. The default behaviour is
  unchanged.
- **Attribute-cache benchmarks and statistics** — new benchmark targets
  `hash_quality_benchmark`, `cache_pressure_benchmark` and
  `mutable_access_benchmark`, and optional instrumentation of the attribute
  cache (hits, collisions and cold misses, printed at exit) compiled in only
  when `PROTO_CACHE_STATS` is defined.

### Changed
- **Concurrent mark via a per-cycle mutable-shard snapshot** — the GC mark
  phase now runs outside the stop-the-world window, concurrently with mutator
  threads. During root collection the collector loads each of the 256
  mutable-shard roots into the new `ProtoSpace::gcMutableSnapshot[]` table,
  and the marker consults only that snapshot. Because every mutation goes
  through a shard-root compare-and-swap and cell fields are immutable after
  construction, the snapshot takes the place of a write barrier: mutators pay
  no per-write cost. The pause is bounded by root collection plus the 2 KB
  snapshot capture, independent of heap size and live-object count; floating
  garbage survives at most one extra cycle. Mark bits are now cleared by a
  bulk unmark over the marked list after sweep (Phase 6), replacing the
  pre-mark unmark pass introduced in 1.2.0, and Phase 7 clears the snapshot.
  Root collection also no longer iterates the unused `stringInternMap`, and
  interned tuples are traced by the concurrent mark instead of inside the
  pause. See `docs/GarbageCollector.md` § "Concurrent Mark Without Barriers".
- **`ProtoSpace` layout** — `ProtoSpace` gains the `gcMutableSnapshot[]` table,
  a `tupleInterner` pointer, and the collection-pacing members
  `gcGrowthPercent`, `gcMinBudgetCells`, `gcAllocationBudget` and
  `cellsSinceLastCycle`. Embedders built against 1.2.0, or against an earlier
  build of this release, must be rebuilt; no source change is required.
- **No GC trigger on free-list exhaustion without a heap limit** —
  `getFreeCells` refills from the OS without waking the collector when the
  freelist runs out. Previously every exhaustion woke the collector, which
  then waited in the stop-the-world quorum for threads that never reached a
  safepoint: in a protoST actor benchmark with 8 workers it waited 2.27 s of a
  2.49 s run and swept once, at the end. (This change left programs with no
  heap limit without any automatic collection; see the allocation-budget
  trigger under "Fixed".)
- **`toImpl` debug checks are compiled out of release builds** — the
  embedded-value tag, expected-tag and 64-byte alignment checks in `toImpl<>`
  now run only when `NDEBUG` is not defined, so release builds reduce the
  conversion to a null check and a mask. In a release build, a wrong-typed
  conversion that used to abort with a diagnostic is now undefined behaviour.
  The protoST `fib` benchmark went from about 500 ms to about 440 ms (median).
- **Install and packaging rules only in a top-level build** — when protoCore
  is included through `add_subdirectory()`, its install and CPack rules no
  longer run as part of the parent project's package. The RPM package license
  is declared as MIT.
- **Documentation restructure** — design specifications moved to
  `docs/archive/design-specs/` and the step-by-step implementation plans were
  deleted; five dated analyses moved to `docs/archive/` with a banner stating
  that their "production ready" assessment is superseded; `DOCUMENTATION.md`
  and `docs/README.md` are now indexes of the current documentation.
  `docs/GarbageCollector.md` documents the concurrent mark, the anatomy of the
  stop-the-world pause and a comparison with other production collectors, and
  `docs/STW_ELIMINATION_RESEARCH.md` records the research on bounding the
  pause. The README lists protoClojure and protoCpp in the ecosystem.
- **Repository hygiene** — build trees, in-source CMake and test outputs,
  static libraries and benchmark executables, generated Doxygen XML, a Python
  virtualenv, performance logs, IDE settings and unreferenced media files are
  no longer tracked and are ignored by `.gitignore`.

### Removed
- `ProtoThread::setManaged()` / `setUnmanaged()` — declared but never
  implemented and without callers; superseded by the unmanaged-region API.
- The unmaintained Sphinx documentation site (`docs/conf.py`, the `.rst`
  pages, `docs/Makefile`, `docs/make.bat` and the Doxyfiles under `docs/`).
  API reference generation uses the root `Doxyfile`. Guides and tutorials that
  described APIs and tools that do not exist were removed as well.

### Fixed
- **The collector no longer dereferences a null work-list entry** — the
  concurrent mark crashed with a segmentation fault at address 0x8 (reading
  `Cell::next_and_flags` of a null `Cell*`, `gcThreadLoop+0xdf8`), seen as
  0.2–0.3 % of protoPython runs with `PROTOCORE_GC_MIN_BUDGET_CELLS=4096`.
  `ProtoThreadExtension::processReferences` read every per-thread cache slot
  twice, once for `ProtoObject::isCellPointer` and once for `asCellPointer`,
  while the owning thread kept rewriting the slot; a slot that changed to
  `nullptr` or an embedded value between the two reads was reported as a null
  child and pushed on the work list. Every `processReferences` implementation
  now loads each reference field once (`if (const Cell* c =
  ProtoObject::asCellPointer(field)) method(ctx, self, c);`), which also stops
  a tagged null (a non-embedded tag with no pointer bits) from being reported.
  The mark loop skips null entries at its single pop site, which also covers
  roots holding a tagged null. In builds with `PROTOCORE_GC_INSTRUMENT` or
  without `NDEBUG`, a `processReferences` that reports `nullptr` aborts with a
  message naming the reporting cell's type.
- **Per-thread caches are stop-the-world roots** — the concurrent mark no
  longer reads the per-thread attribute cache and mutable-value cache, which
  their owning threads rewrite at any time. `gcThreadLoop` pushes the cells
  of every registered thread's caches during the Phase 2 root scan, while
  the owners are parked, and `ProtoThreadExtension::processReferences`
  reports nothing. The mark phase again reads only immutable fields, which
  restores the documented "Concurrent Mark Without Barriers" invariants.
  The stop-the-world pause gains a fixed scan of 5,120 field loads per
  thread. Embedder caches that hold cell pointers must be kept alive through
  a root captured under stop-the-world or be dropped when
  `getGCCycleCount()` changes (`docs/GarbageCollector.md`).
- **A double's hash agrees with equality** — `DoubleImplementation::getHash`
  hashed the bit pattern, so NaNs of different sign or payload (x86
  `0.0/0.0` is a negative NaN, `std::nan("")` a positive one) were different
  `ProtoSet`/`ProtoMultiset` elements, and whether `-0.0` and `0.0` collided
  depended on the standard library. All NaNs now hash as the canonical quiet
  NaN and `-0.0` hashes as `0.0`; other doubles keep their hash. Hashes still
  differ across numeric kinds (`1` and `1.0`), as documented for `ProtoSet`:
  a language whose equality crosses kinds supplies its own hash.
- **`ProtoList::has` with integers beyond `long long`** — both list forms
  compared integer elements with `asLong`, which throws
  `std::overflow_error` for a `LargeInteger` outside that range, so `has`
  threw on a list holding such an element (or when asked for one). Integers
  are now compared by value with `Integer::compare`, as `ProtoTuple::has`
  already did.
- **The GC cycle counter advances in every build configuration** — the only
  increment of `gcCycleCount` sat inside the `PROTOCORE_GC_REINCLUDE_SURVIVORS`
  block, so with `-DPROTOCORE_GC_REINCLUDE_SURVIVORS=OFF` `getGCCycleCount()`
  stayed at zero and heap-limit reclamation waits, which wait for the counter
  to advance, never saw a cycle complete. The counter is now incremented for
  every cycle; the survivor re-chain still uses the same cycle number to decide
  fold cycles. The heap-growth trigger tests now run in both configurations.
- **GC cycles start from allocation when no heap limit is set** — without a
  hard heap limit (the default), nothing started a collection unless the
  embedder called `triggerGC()`, and no embedder in the ecosystem did, so the
  heap grew by every cell allocated. In a probe that allocated garbage with a
  constant live set of 1,000 strings, the heap reached 257 million cells
  (15.3 GiB) with zero cycles. `getFreeCells` now charges every batch it hands
  out against an allocation budget and requests a cycle through the existing
  GC-thread wake-up once the cells handed out since the previous cycle reach
  `max(PROTOCORE_GC_MIN_BUDGET_CELLS, retained × PROTOCORE_GC_GROWTH_PERCENT
  / 100)`. `retained` is `heapSize − freeCellsCount` at the end of the cycle,
  minus the cells handed out while it ran. A cycle is requested only if
  contexts have submitted garbage since the previous cycle. Cells still owned
  by a live context can never be reclaimed, and cycles started without
  submissions only re-scanned them under stop-the-world: in
  `immutable_sharing_benchmark` four such cycles reclaimed nothing, and their
  stop-the-world root collection grew to 439 ms. The defaults are 1,048,576
  cells (64 MiB) and 100%; `PROTOCORE_GC_GROWTH_PERCENT=0` restores the
  previous behaviour. The same probe now holds the heap at 3.9 million cells (240 MiB)
  across 102 cycles and finishes in 5.9 s instead of 14.5 s. The check runs
  only on the refill path. It is inactive while a hard heap limit is set, and
  the per-thread allocation fast path is unchanged. A requested cycle still
  needs every running thread to park, so loops whose allocations all run
  inside critical sections must call `ProtoContext::safepoint()`.
- **String hashes depend on content, not rope shape** — `getHash` on a heap
  string returned a cached hash that mixed its children's hashes, so equal
  content split differently by concatenation hashed differently (a 47-byte
  literal and the same text built as 37 + 10 bytes). Every structure keyed by
  `getHash` missed equal strings, including sparse lists and tuple hashes.
  Heap strings now hash with the structure-independent FNV-1a content hash
  that string interning already uses, and inline strings use the same FNV-1a
  over their bytes, so a string hashes the same whether it is inline or
  heap-backed.
- **`LargeInteger` hashing covers every digit** — the hash used only the
  lowest digit, so every multiple of 2^64 collided and hash-keyed structures
  kept a single entry for 2^64, 2^65 and 2^70.
- **`ProtoObject::asDouble` on large integers** — no longer throws for a
  `LargeInteger` beyond the range of `long long`; the value is converted
  through its decimal digits, and out-of-range values become ±infinity.
- **Exact integer/double comparison** — `ProtoObject::compare` converted the
  integer to `double`, which threw beyond `long long` and rounded above 2^53
  (`2**70 + 1` compared equal to `2.0**70`). The integer is now compared with
  `floor(d)` as integers. NaN compares as before; ±infinity is handled
  explicitly.
- **`objectPrototype` is mutable** — `ProtoSpace::objectPrototype` was created
  immutable, so the first `setAttribute` on it returned a new object and left
  every previously stored reference stale (in protoJS,
  `Object.prototype.foo = 1` was silently lost). `getPrototype` on
  `objectPrototype` itself now returns `nullptr` instead of looping back to
  itself, and `ProtoObject::clone(ctx, true)` now returns a mutable clone (the
  flag was ignored). Across ten protoJS test262 families, passing tests went
  from 8397 to 8451 of 9823.

### Performance
- **Tuple interning uses a sharded hash table** — the interner was a binary
  search tree under `ProtoSpace::globalMutex` that never rebalanced and, keyed
  by allocation-ordered pointers, degenerated into a linked list walked twice
  per tuple creation. `TupleInterner` uses 64 shards, each with its own hash
  index and a mutex that is never held across an allocation; lookup runs
  before allocation. Interned tuples remain perennial. Interning 100,000
  distinct tuples timed out after 120 s before and now takes 0.03 s, as does
  the 4-thread concurrent test (previously 82 s).
- **`getOwnAttributeDirect` consults the attribute cache** — it resolved the
  mutable snapshot and then walked the attribute tree on every call; it now
  checks the per-thread `(snapshot, name)` attribute cache first, like
  `getAttribute`. No behavioural change.
- **Better attribute-cache slot distribution** — cell pointers are 64-byte
  aligned, so their low 6 bits are always zero; the cache index now shifts
  them out. `object_access_benchmark` used 6.6% fewer cycles and
  `hash_quality_benchmark` 16% fewer.
- **Attribute-cache entries padded to 32 bytes** — two entries now fit in one
  64-byte cache line and the table is allocated 64-byte aligned, at a cost of
  8 KB per thread. `object_access_benchmark` used 3.6% fewer cycles with 27%
  fewer L1 data-cache misses.

### Tests
- `ConcurrentMarkSafety.ThreadCacheSlotFlipsDuringMark` flips the main
  thread's attribute-cache and mutable-value-cache slots between a cell and a
  non-cell from a helper thread while cycles run every few thousand cells; it
  crashed within about 25 ms before the null work-list fix.
  `GCMark.NullReferenceIsSkipped` pins a tagged null in a root set (it crashed
  before the fix), and
  `GCMarkDeathTest.NullReferenceFromProcessReferencesIsReported` checks that
  instrumented and debug builds name a cell type whose `processReferences`
  reports `nullptr`.
- `NumericCompareTest` (four cases): every NaN is unordered in both operand
  orders against NaNs, ±0.0, ±inf, SmallIntegers and ±2^70; for ordered
  numbers from -inf to +inf (including -2^70, -0.0/0/0.0, 2^53+1 and 2^70)
  the sign of `partialCompare` matches `compare` and the expected order;
  strings, objects and mixed pairs; and NaN elements do not alias numbers in
  `ProtoSet`, `ProtoMultiset`, `ProtoList` and `ProtoTuple`.
- `NumericTest.DoubleHashAgreesWithEquality` checks that quiet, negative and
  payload NaNs hash alike, that `-0.0` and `0.0` hash alike, and that a set
  treats them as one element (the NaN cases failed before the fix).
- `ListTest.HasComparesLargeIntegersByValue` checks `has` on inline and AVL
  lists holding 2^70 against an equal distinct object, neighbours and small
  integers (it threw `std::overflow_error` before the fix).
- `ConcurrentMarkSafety.AttributeCacheChurnWithSmallBudget` writes and reads
  attributes on fresh objects through the public API for three seconds with
  a 4096-cell budget, then checks a pinned live set.
- `GCHeapGrowthTriggerTest` (five cases): with no heap limit, garbage
  allocation with a constant live set starts cycles and keeps the heap bounded
  without collecting live objects. The main case failed before the fix with 0
  cycles and 15,990,784 cells of growth. `PROTOCORE_GC_GROWTH_PERCENT=0`
  disables automatic cycles, malformed values fall back to the defaults, the
  budget scales with the retained cells, and a spent budget waits until
  garbage has been submitted.
- New suites and cases: `ConcurrentMarkSafety` (mutation during mark, no lost
  mutable references), `UnmanagedRegionTest` (six cases), three `TupleTest`
  interning cases, `StringTest.EqualContentHashesEqualWhateverTheRepresentation`,
  `SetTest.ExplicitHashKeysElementsByTheCallersHash` and three `NumericTest`
  cases for large-integer hashing, conversion and comparison.
- `SwarmTest.OneMillionConcats` and `SwarmTest.LargeRopeIndexAccess` are
  enabled again (the rope GC failures they were disabled for no longer
  reproduce), and `SwarmTest.LargeRopeIndexAccessUnderHeapPressure` builds a
  large rope under a tight heap limit so reclamation runs during
  construction.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-22
### Added
- **`ProtoObject::setAttributeIfEqual` — public attribute compare-and-swap** —
  `setAttributeIfEqual(ctx, name, expected, newValue)` writes `newValue` only
  if the receiver's current OWN value for `name` is still pointer-identical to
  `expected`, returning whether the swap happened. It exposes the shard-root
  CAS loop that `setAttribute` already runs internally, so an embedder can
  build a lock-free read-modify-write (e.g. appending to a list held under an
  attribute) with a CAS-retry loop instead of an external mutex. `expected ==
  nullptr` means "the attribute is currently absent". Requires a mutable
  receiver; an immutable receiver is a no-op returning `false`. This is the
  protoCore primitive that lets protoST drop its per-actor mailbox mutex.
- **Configurable heap allocation limit with reliable OOM detection** — a new
  `ProtoSpace::setHeapLimits(softCells, hardCells)` lets an embedder cap the
  `Cell` heap instead of growing it unbounded until the OS is exhausted. Both
  limits are in `Cell`s; `0` (the default) disables them and the allocator is
  bit-for-bit the previous unbounded path — the entire feature is gated on
  `maxHeapSize > 0`.
  - `getFreeCells` clamps every OS request to the remaining headroom, so
    `heapSize` never crosses the hard ceiling for ordinary allocations.
  - A thread that must wait for the GC leaves the running set first
    (`ProtoSpace::waitForHeapHeadroom` → `reclaimWaitLocked`), so it never
    stalls the Stop-The-World quorum.
  - The blocking check runs at outermost critical-section entry
    (`ProtoContext::heapLimitCheckpoint`, called from the `CriticalSection`
    constructor): a thread mid tree-build holds un-anchored cells and must stay
    in the running set, so it cannot wait there. An allocation that drains the
    cell pool *inside* a critical section may overshoot by at most one OS batch.
  - OOM is detected from per-cycle *reclamation*: the GC publishes
    `reclaimedLastCycle`; two consecutive completed cycles that each reclaim
    zero cells while the heap is at its ceiling are genuine OOM. A mark-phase
    live count would miss a live context's un-submitted young generation, which
    fills the heap without entering `markedList`. On confirmed OOM,
    `outOfMemoryCallback` is invoked once, then protoCore performs a controlled
    `std::abort()` with a diagnostic.
  - `getFreeCells(const ProtoThread*)` → `getFreeCells(ProtoContext*)`; new
    `ProtoSpace` members `softHeapLimit`, `reclaimedLastCycle`,
    `liveCellsLastCycle`, `memoryReclaimedCV`; new `ProtoContext` method
    `heapLimitCheckpoint`.
  - See `DESIGN.md` § "The Heap Allocation Limit and Out-of-Memory Detection"
    and `docs/archive/design-specs/2026-05-22-allocation-limit-oom-design.md`.

### Changed
- **Interned strings are always perennial** — `SymbolTable::intern` now builds
  every symbol with a null `ProtoContext` unconditionally; the `is_strong`
  parameter and the never-called `removeWeak()` weak-eviction path are removed.
  Previously a "weak" symbol could be allocated against a `ProtoContext` and
  collected by the GC — but every caller already interned strong, so the weak
  path was dead code, and it was unsound to keep: a perennial symbol whose
  bucket got evicted would lose its canonical pointer and break pointer-identity
  symbol comparison. Now, when a symbol is created — or a non-interned string is
  converted to one — the interned string is allocated outside the GC and lives
  for the lifetime of the process. No public API change
  (`ProtoString::createSymbol` is unchanged). See `core/SymbolTable.cpp` and
  DESIGN.md § "Mechanism A — Perpetual allocation via `ProtoContext* = nullptr`".

### Fixed
- **GC stale-mark bug** — Mark phase set the per-cell mark bit on every reachable
  cell, but Sweep only cleared that bit on cells inside the captured
  `segmentsToProcess` snapshot. Cells reachable from a root that lived outside
  that snapshot (young cells whose owning context never submitted, perpetual
  prototypes, tuple/string interner entries) carried `mark=1` over from the
  previous cycle. The next cycle's mark drain skipped them via the
  `if (!isMarked())` guard and never traced their children, so any candidate
  reachable exclusively through that path was freed by Sweep while still live.
  Reproduced 100% with `PROTOCORE_GC_REINCLUDE_SURVIVORS` enabled and a
  16k-node mutable-object workload (protoJS `tree_traversal` benchmark crashed 0/5).
- **Fix** — Added a pre-mark unmark pass that walks the live graph from all
  roots and clears the mark bit on every reachable cell before Phase 4 begins.
  Cost is `O(reachable cells)`, comparable to Mark itself, in exchange for a
  clean tricolor invariant at the start of every cycle. This pass was later
  replaced by the bulk unmark of the concurrent mark (see the concurrent mark
  entry above); its `docs/GarbageCollector.md` section no longer exists.

### Tests
- 196/196 protoCore tests pass — including the `AllocationLimit*` suite
  (hard-limit reclamation, soft limit, `setHeapLimits` validation and an
  unrecoverable-OOM death test) and the `AttributeCas*` suite (compare-and-swap
  match / mismatch / absent / immutable, plus an 8-thread no-lost-update
  concurrency proof).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-02
### Added
- **Performance Benchmarking Suite**: Integrated micro-benchmarks for List, SparseList, Object Access, and String Concatenation into the CMake build system.
- **JIT Impact Analysis**: Comprehensive performance grounding for the "Mechanism over Policy" strategy, validating structural sharing efficiency and identifying attribute lookup bottlenecks.
- **String Handling Refactor**: Introduced **Inline Strings** (up to 6 UTF-8 bytes) stored directly in `ProtoObject*` tagged pointers.
- Optimized hybrid data model for `ProtoString` (Inline + Rope).
- Enhanced `RopeCharacterIterator` and `ProtoStringIteratorImplementation` for performance.
- Direct bitwise comparison and hashing for inline strings.

### Fixed
- **API contract: PROTO_NONE for missing keys** — Align `getAttribute` and `ProtoSparseList::getAt` with the documented API: return `PROTO_NONE` instead of `nullptr` when an attribute or key is not found.
- **ProtoObject::getAttribute** — Returns `PROTO_NONE` instead of `nullptr` when the attribute does not exist (ObjectTest.GetMissingAttribute).
- **ProtoObject::hasAttribute** — Correctly treats `PROTO_NONE` as "not found" when checking attribute existence.
- **ProtoSparseList::getAt** — Returns `PROTO_NONE` instead of `nullptr` when the key is not in the map (ContextTest.LocalVariableAllocation).
- **ProtoMultiset** — `add`, `count`, and `remove` now treat `PROTO_NONE` as a missing entry, fixing MultisetTest.AddAndCount, MultisetTest.Remove, and MultisetTest.RemoveNonExistent.

### Tests
- All 136 tests pass (100% pass rate) following the performance infrastructure integration.

## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-22
- Initial release of protoCore shared library.
